# tdd-node-practice

I've been learning how to create tests with Jest, and some of how TDD works and the purpose behind it. Each of these scripts have at least four tests that go into them to cover edge cases.

The two that I feel are the best showcase of my skills are arrayInfo.js (and the unit tests) as well as the caesar cipher in caesar.js.
